aprima-scripts
==============

Aprima is a piece of shit EMR. This repo contains scripts that work around it's many, many bugs.

Background
----------

For the loooooongest time, medical records were kept in one physical form or another. This is incredibly inefficient, and presents a huge hurdle for cost-cutting, research, and quality control. Accordingly, the US government made switching to electronic medical record systems one of the cornerstone initiatives to cut absurdly high medical costs in America.

Unfortunately, they chose to do this by offering very generous tax breaks to the medical offices, clinics, and hospitals who made the switch (up to 64,000 USD over 6 years per clinician)--which has created a marketplace that allows even shoddy EMR's to thrive and profit tremendously.

Aprima is such an EMR. Not only is the work-flow *painful* (one of our clinicians takes some freaky pleasure in demonstrating how a particular common function takes him 3 minutes and 19 mouse clicks to run--which adds up after 12 visits per day), but it is also buggy as all hell.

...Of course, Aprima is a step up from the first EMR we tried...

Regardless, with their tech support incredibly slow (average bug-fix wait time is some 3 months), it ended up being easier for my clinic to just task me with developing simple solutions that work around the buggy front-end, and retrieve desires data, etc. directly from the EMR's DBMS.

Usage
-----

I use an Ubuntu-flavored Linux, and I know that all of these scripts work just fine on my machine. If you want to run any of these, I would strongly urge you to do so on Ubuntu as well.

Specific usage usage details accompany each script.

Good luck!

(And I'm so sorry that you're using this piece of crap EMR...)
